## Hello my name is James Sayegh.

Here are the projects i have worked on over the years:

### Sand Simulation (Cellular automata) ([link](https://github.com/Persona036/SandSimulation))

This was made using Processing, a GUI library for java.
The design is very simple as the sand effected is simulated by simply applying certain rules to each pixel which alters their behavior.


### Discord Bot ([link](https://github.com/Persona036/Void-lotus))

A fully interactable discord bot, with several features all managed by a command handler, coupled with MongoDB as a Database. The bot also takes use of several API's such as TENOR gif api and the Osu! api.
